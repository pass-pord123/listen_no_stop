    When AIDS first emerged,  no one could have predicted how the epidemic would spread across the world  and how many millions of lives it would change. Thee was no real idea what cause it  and consequently no real idea how to protect against it.  Now we know from bitter experience that AIDS is caused by the virus HIV, and that it can destroy families, communities and whole continents. However, experience has also shown us that the right approaches can and do result in lower national HIV infection rates and less suffering for those affected by the epidemic. Already, more than twenty-five million people around the world have died of AIDS-related diseases. 33 million people around the world are now living with HIV, and the most of these are likely to die over the next decade or so. It is disappointing that the global numbers of people infected with HIV continue to rise, despite the fact that effective prevention strategies already exist.
