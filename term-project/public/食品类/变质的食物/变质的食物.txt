Ryan: It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.
Corrie: I’m happy to do it. First, though, let’s see what you have in your fridge.
Ryan: I have tons of food in there.
Corrie: What is that? It looks moldy.
Ryan: Oh, that’s cheese. I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.
Corrie: Okay, but look at the “best if used by” date. This expired three months ago. What about this?
Ryan: That’s hamburger. Maybe you could make some spaghetti with meatballs.
Corrie: Not with this rotten meat. It’s definitely gone bad. Can’t you tell by the discoloration? Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.
Ryan: I guess you’re right. I bet this milk isn’t any good either, is it?
Corrie: Nope. It’s gone sour, and you might as well throw out this bread, too. It’s stale.
Ryan: Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?
Corrie: Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tainted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted. You do have a lot of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.
Ryan: I don’t like things to go to waste.
Corrie: I guess not. I’m still willing to make you dinner, but we’ll have to do some shopping. My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually give people food poisoning, and I don’t want to start now.
Ryan: Okay, okay, give me a list and I’ll go to the market.
Corrie: And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can do about getting rid of all of this hazardous waste!
