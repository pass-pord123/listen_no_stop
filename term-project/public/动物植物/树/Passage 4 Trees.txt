Trees are the oldest living organisms on earth.  The great age of trees makes them useful for all sorts of scientific research.  Besides, trees also have a lot to teach us about being part of a community  and how cooperation is better for a society than competition.  A community of trees growing together share all of the available resources with each other.  They do this through their roots, through the soil,  and also through the networks of tiny fungi growing in the soil between them.  They donâ€™t only share with trees of the same species.  Any type of tree can benefit.  Trees grown in city conditions do not live as long as those growing in a natural environment,  maybe because they are more isolated.  According to people who work with trees,  a community with a good mixture of different species  is stronger and more resistant to insects and diseases.
