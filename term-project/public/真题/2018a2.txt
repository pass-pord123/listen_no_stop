Emotional Reaction to Music
No matter who you are, where you live,
or what your cultural background is,
people get some pleasure from listening to their favorite music.
However, some people are simply not capable of enjoying music.
This is not because they can't experience pleasure at all.
They don't have trouble hearing music properly, either.
Instead, they're just indifferent to music.
Researchers have conducted studies to find out
why some people have no emotional reaction to music.
However, despite their efforts, the mystery remains.
