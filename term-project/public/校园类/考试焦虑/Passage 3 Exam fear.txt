Exams are a way of assessing what a student has learned during the academic year. Apart from this, it is also a method through which the students' learning and grasping abilities are evaluated and graded by the teacher. This makes it very important for students to learn well and achieve good scores in the exam. However, for most students, exams bring with them lots of tension, stress and anxiety. The main reason for this is the increased pressure that they receive from their parents and teachers. Although a little bit of exam fear is important to study before the exam, too much tension can hinder the students' ability to do well. Many times, due to exam fear, students tend to forget what they have learned, thus scoring less than they could have. Hence, it is extremely crucial for students to learn about how to reduce exam fear. Thus they can give their examination confidently, subsequently earning good grades.
