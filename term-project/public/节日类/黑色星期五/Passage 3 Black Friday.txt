Black Friday is the beginning of the Christmas shopping season in America. It falls the day after Thanksgiving celebration and has become a discount shopping day  when millions of US shoppers are tempted by massive savings. There are two explanations for the day’s name.  Some claim it was coined to illustrate the point at which retailers start to make a profit, or go “into the black”. Others believe it was first coined by the Philadelphia police department to describe the crowded pavements and traffic jams on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  
As many employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the day after off, followed by a weekend, potential shoppers will largely increase. So, Black Friday has been the busiest shopping day of the year. It was common for retailers to open at 6:00 a.m. But recent years have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to keep up with the competition.
