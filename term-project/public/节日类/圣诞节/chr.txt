Christmas is considered a major holiday in the United States.Shopping malls have big sales,every-body gets happier,and everywhere shows red and green.As early as one month before December 25th,houses in the residential areas would be dressed up with flashing lights,ornaments,and sculptures.Normally lifeless downtown steets would be illuminated by trees featuring dazzling lights,and skyscrapers would join in with decorations hanging down from top to bottom.
Stores aim at this"shopping season"for large sales as everyone is pruchasing gifts for everyone else.Santa Claus and reindeers come out to attract customers and perform at special events as entertainers.
The Christmas spirit permeates throughout the country.Starting three or four days before Christmas,employees go home on their vacation,and students begin their winter break.All the major transportation systems like trains,buses,and airplanes are all full of people returing to their families.After two weeks,people return to work feeling refreshed to go about their regular activities.
