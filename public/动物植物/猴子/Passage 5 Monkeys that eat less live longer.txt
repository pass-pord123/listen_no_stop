A study of monkeys of over a 20-year-period suggests  that eating less may extend life and prevent disease.  American researchers said they believe  their findings could apply to people as well.  Half of the monkeys were permitted to eat as much as they wanted.  The other half ate a controlled diet.  The researchers found that 37% of the monkeys that ate as much as they wanted  had died of causes related to aging after 20 years.  In comparison, only 13% of the monkeys on restricted diets had died.  Extended life was not the only observable difference between the groups.  The monkeys that ate less had half the amount of heart disease and cancer.  In addition, there is also a difference in the appearance.  The monkeys that ate less look younger and healthier than fatter monkeys on a normal diet.  The researchers say this study is not complete  and that they will continue to observe the remaining monkeys throughout their lives.
