If you’re invited to a Scottish home on New Year’s Eve, it’s important to know what to bring with you: a lump of coal, some shortbread and some whisky.   
The coal signifies warmth, so you’re wishing that the people you visit will have enough heat in the coming year. The shortbread represents food, so you’re hoping that the people will have enough to eat. And whisky was called “the water of life” by Scots, so it means you want the hosts to have enough to drink.  
There is one more key task you still have to perform as a guest. The first person to knock on a neighbour’s door is supposed to be a tall, dark, handsome man. If you are, you’ll bring good luck to the household. But if that’s not you, don’t ring the bell just yet.Wait for a while and the right person is bound to turn up soon!
