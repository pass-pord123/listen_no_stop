This mixture is stirred slowly while cooling to prevent large ice crystals from forming. The result I a smoothly textured ice cream. The meaning of the term “ice cream” varies from one country to another. In some countries, like the U.S.A, the term ice cream applies only to a specific variety. And the US government regulates the commercial use of all these terms based on quantities of ingredients. In others, like Italy, one world is enough for all the variants.
