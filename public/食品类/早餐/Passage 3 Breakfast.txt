Breakfast is a considered a very important meal, and is essential to having a good start to the day. In fact, once a year there is a weekly campaign called "Think breakfast" to encourage people to eat better breakfast. 
A traditional English breakfast includes sausages, bacon, fried eggs, mushrooms, baked beans, fried tomatoes, and toast with butter. However, these days most people don't eat traditional breakfast everyday, or even at all. This is because it is very unhealthy, and many people don't have time to cook. These days, most people eat a bowl of cereal with milk, or have a slice of toast with butter.  In fact, in the UK the average person eats about 6 kilos of cereal every year ——this is much more than most European countries. In the winter many people eat a hot cereal called "porridge", which is made from oats. This is especially popular in Scotland.
