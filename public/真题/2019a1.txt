We often use slang expressions when we talk, because they are so vivid and colorful.
However, they are usually out of place in formal writing because of a number of drawbacks.
They go out of date quickly and become tiresome if used too much.
And they may communicate clearly to some readers but not to others.
In general, we should avoid the use of slang in our writing.
